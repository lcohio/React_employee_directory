## API UI Directory

This project is a re-visit of the original API Employee Directory, but instead of vanilla code on the front-end I used React
and create-react-app to render the UI.

In the project, you can run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies, and `npm start` to view on the dev server.
The default location is `localhost:3000`.

Technologies used:
  -React
  -create-react-app
  -Google Fonts
  -Normalize CSS reset
